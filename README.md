# PyTorch Concepts

PyC (PyTorch Concepts) is a library built upon PyTorch to easily write and train Concept-Based Deep Learning models.

## Low-level APIs

**Concept data types** (`pyc.base`):

- `ConceptTensor`: A subclass of `torch.Tensor` which stores and retrieves concepts by name.
- `ConceptDistribution`: Subclass of `torch.distributions.Distribution` which ensures that samples drawn from the distribution are `ConceptTensors`.

**Base concept layers** (`pyc.nn.base`):

- `ConceptLayer`: A layer taking as input a common `tensor` and producing a `ConceptTensor` as output.
- `ProbabilisticConceptLayer`: A layer taking as input a common `tensor` and producing a (normal) `ConceptDistribution` as output.
- `ConceptMemory`: A layer with a set of embeddings which can be decoded into different concept states.

**Base functions** (`pyc.nn.functional`):

- `intervene`: A function to intervene on concept scores.
- `intervene_on_concept_graph`: A function to intervene on a concept adjacency matrix (it can be used to perform do-interventions).
- `concept_embedding_mixture`: A function to generate a mixture of concept embeddings and concept predictions.

## Mid-level APIs

**Concept bottleneck layers** (`pyc.nn.bottleneck`):

- `ConceptBottleneck`: A vanilla concept bottleneck from ["Concept Bottleneck Models"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04612) (ICML 2020).
- `ConceptResidualBottleneck`: A residual bottleneck composed of a set of supervised concepts and a residual unsupervised embedding from ["Promises and Pitfalls of Black-Box Concept Learning Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13314) (ICML 2021, workshop).
- `ConceptEmbeddingBottleneck`: A bottleneck composed of supervised concept embeddings from ["Concept Embedding Models: Beyond the Accuracy-Explainability Trade-Off"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09056) (NeurIPS 2022).

## Evaluation APIs

**Datasets** (`pyc.data`):

- `ToyDataset`: A toy dataset loader. XOR, Trigonometry, and Dot datasets are from ["Concept Embedding Models: Beyond the Accuracy-Explainability Trade-Off"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09056) (NeurIPS 2022). The Checkmark dataset is from ["Causal Concept Embedding Models: Beyond Causal Opacity in Deep Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16507).
- `CompletenessDataset`: A dataset loader for the completeness score from ["Beyond Concept Bottleneck Models: How to Make Black Boxes Intervenable?"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13544).
- `ColorMNISTDataset`: A dataset loader for MNIST Even/Odd where colors act as confounders inspired from ["Explaining Classifiers with Causal Concept Effect (CaCE)"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07165) and ["Interpretable Concept-Based Memory Reasoning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15527).
- `CelebA`: A dataset loader for CelebA dataset with attributes as concepts from ["Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7766) (ICCV 2015).

**Metrics** (`pyc.metrics`):

- `intervention_score`: A score measuring the effectiveness of concept interventions from ["Concept Bottleneck Models"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04612) (ICML 2020).
- `completeness_score`: A score measuring concept completeness from ["On Completeness-aware Concept-Based Explanations in Deep Neural Networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07969) (NeurIPS 2020).
- `cace_score`: A score measuring causal concept effects (CaCE) from ["Explaining Classifiers with Causal Concept Effect (CaCE)"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07165).
