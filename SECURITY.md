# PyC Security Policy

The PyC Team takes security seriously and appreciates responsible reports from the community.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you’ve found a security issue in PyC, please contact the PyC Team privately instead of opening a public issue.

You can reach us at our email: **pyc.devteam@gmail.com**.

Please include:
- A short description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if possible)
- Any details that might help us understand the problem

## Our Approach
We will review security reports as time allows.  
Because PyC is maintained with limited time and resources, we **cannot make specific guarantees** about response times or patch timelines.

That said, we will do our best to look into legitimate reports and address important issues when we can.

## Thank You
Thank you for helping keep PyC safe and reliable.
