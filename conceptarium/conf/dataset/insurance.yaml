  Accident: "Severity of the accident: A four-level factor with levels None, Mild, Moderate, and Severe. This variable categorizes the severity of the accident, which is crucial for determining the extent of insurance coverage and the associated payout."
  MakeModel: "Car's model: A five-level factor with levels SportsCar, Economy, FamilySedan, Luxury, and SuperLuxury. This variable indicates the make and model of the insured vehicle, influencing risk assessment based on the type of vehicle, its typical usage, and the likelihood of damage in an accident."

  Mileage: "Mileage: A four-level factor with levels FiveThou, TwentyThou, FiftyThou, and Domino. Represents the total number of miles driven by the insured vehicle, which is a critical determinant of the risk of an accident. Higher mileage can increase the likelihood of wear and tear or accidents."

  OtherCarCost: "Costs for the other car: A four-level factor with levels Thousand, TenThou, HundredThou, and Million. Represents the cost of another vehicle involved in the accident, which is used to calculate potential liability and payout for insurance claims."
  OtherCar: "Other cars involved in the accident: A two-level factor with levels False and True. Indicates whether another vehicle was involved in the accident, which affects the distribution of fault and the size of the insurance payout."
