"""Bipartite-graph mixin and abstract base for concept→task models.

A *bipartite* concept model splits its variables into two layers — concepts and
tasks — with edges only from concepts to tasks (no concept→concept edges). This
module provides:

* :class:`BipartiteMixin` — derives the bipartite :class:`ConceptGraph` from a
  list of ``task_names`` (the rest of the annotation labels become the concept
  layer). Shared by every bipartite model so the graph-building logic lives in
  one place.
* :class:`BipartiteModel` — abstract bipartite model (a ``DirectedGraphModel``
  using the mixin) and the parent of the concrete bipartite models (CBM, CEM).
  It builds the bipartite graph but leaves ``_build_probabilistic_model``
  abstract, so each concrete model assembles its own probabilistic model
  explicitly.
